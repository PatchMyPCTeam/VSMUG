@Jon - Hybrid AAD is not required for Tenant Attach. For instance, when you enable Tenant Attach for All Devices, you can even see your servers in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center, which are most likely only on premises Active Directory joined. If you wanted to do actions in Intune besides the Config Manager client actions, then you would need it to be Azure AD Joined, and MDM Registered, thus Intune enrolled.(Jon (Unverified) asked ""Is Hybrid AAD required for Tenant Attach?"")"
